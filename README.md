# Reversing a Linked List in a Snake Game :snake: #
A snake game that I built in C++ with the implementation of doubly linked list.<br></br>
This small project was inspired by Cl√©ment Mihailescu, who have also built a snake game by reversing
a linked list in react JS. His video is in this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Rkib_fvowE
